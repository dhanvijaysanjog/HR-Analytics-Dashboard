# HR Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI

## **Project Name :** 
HR Analytics: A Complete Employee Data Analysis Project using Power BI Dashboard


## **OBJECTIVES :** 
This Power BI HR analytics enables the HR manager and business leaders with comprehensive insights into analyzing and monitoring employee data to make informed decisions on employee retention, development, and recruitments.

It also comprises a trendline and target line to help the Human Resource manager track the progress towards reduction in attrition. It plots, with the help of charts, the distribution of employees and attrition rate on the basis of gender, age group, job satisfaction, and field of education. Legends and filters have also been added to the chart to let the human resource manager drill down into further detail.

In the project, I had a chance to : 
* Dive deep into HR data through deciphering and extracting useful information from it.
* Create interactive visualization dashboards for key HR metrics.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to aid in strategic decision-making.
